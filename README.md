- 👋 Hi, I’m @sergio-o-mx
- 👀 I’m interested in Android Development using Kotlin as my main language for this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly unit test on MVVM, I'm also studying a bit of Flutter and Dart.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related with mobile development, though some stuff related to Firebase would also be cool.
